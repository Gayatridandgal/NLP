The hidden money manifestation principles I learned from shirlest resonated with me so deeply. It’s like unlocking a whole new dimension of possibilities.

But im in  way

"Congratulations champ, am just starting off at 41, I want to ask you what choices and Decisions did you make ?"
What did you do to make $3 million?
You’re absolutely right I’m 60 and I’m still not what you would call Rich and no one’s ever helped me. Do a damn thing in life or give me anything. I do pretty well but I did it on my own so I get what you’re saying 100%.
I’m 26 and I just started my journey and working on my self and being intentional on taking action with my life my first step I’m  50-60 hours to get out of some debt good thing no woman or kids so a little easier to get done
"I’m only 17, do you have any advice for starting off"

"How can you be rich, if you can't even write English, ""learnt?'"
End of your 20’s is magical
"I literally added this into my blog, my lifestyle blog for weight loss, healthy, living and all that 
by the end of the day you have to put in the work take action because no one is coming to save you believe in yourself, and do it"
Thanks I needed this :)
Am so broke…I don’t even have 20k in my savings
Wat business u did bro😊
Congratulations Sir. I just got that realization and I'm on my way building my future. The problem is that I haven't found my passion yet. I'm a jack of all trades and I guess that's the problem.
I have 1million dollar
U saved me so much time thanks

Confidati la figlia del brigadiere era attiva
Ooooh. Grats! Im 32; what can I learn from you? 🫡

"What are you rich people doing to help others or is it just about greed? I’m 67 years old on a fixed income, but I help the poor and homeless. Do you?"
Waooo😮😊
Exactly

For this reason I could offer you a great deal at a wildlife safari in Uganda. I promise the best all the way
​ @georgeh.5126 P off Nigrian wonga wonga scammers 😂😂😂
Ninja scammers 😂
What did you do?
"OBVIOUSLY, investing is not for everyone my friend, I don't know under what illusion you live that something is for everyone.
Interest in investments already represents a micro percent of the population; If you think about crypto, then it's an even better sub-niche. I made a profit of 280 thousand dólares investing in crypto assets."
"Congratulations bro, I admire you"
 @paulocasella3778 that’s the right spelling 😉
"Ya cool, but what did you actually do? An important job? Because I'm 26 today and there's no way I'm gonna work in tech or in healthcare. Zero."
"Yesss,. Peace and blessings for all the beautiful soul's"
Sheesh goals nice bro! I’m 23 & I’m getting this consistency down paxk
Thanks for inspiring me ❤ respect sir!!
"Hello my beautiful fan👋❤️ I find it really strange to write to you because I don't usually chat with fans, but after that I realized how much you like my page and that I follow it.
❤"

"I hope nobody is actually reaching out to random ""advisers"" in comment threads, they're all scammers."
@fredm1 can you explain how you got to that retirement savings?
So why your here? increasing productivity by watching stuff that make no sense 😂 just kidding bro  reminding who you lie   to
" @Einstein_rocks  Any video title that mentions money will have these clusterbot threads where someone ultimately recommends some ""adviser"" who will scam you out of your life savings"
Fake
hope to be same as you sir 💪🙏
